1. IntroductionThis document outlines the steps for Unit Testing, Peer Review, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for MicroStrategy projects.2. Unit Testing2.1 PurposeEnsure individual components of the MicroStrategy project function correctly.2.2 StepsIdentify Test Cases: Define functionalities and create test cases with expected outcomes.Setup Environment: Configure MicroStrategy and load necessary data.Execute Tests: Run test cases and document results.Analyze Results: Compare actual vs. expected outcomes; investigate discrepancies.Fix Issues: Address defects and retest.Document Findings: Record test cases, results, and fixes.3. Peer Review3.1 PurposeEnsure code quality and adherence to standards.3.2 StepsCode Review: Review code for logic, standards, and best practices.Feedback: Provide constructive feedback.Revise: Make necessary changes based on feedback.Approval: Obtain final approval from the reviewer.4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)4.1 PurposeValidate the system meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.4.2 StepsPrepare UAT Environment: Set up the UAT environment with realistic data.Define Test Scenarios: Collaborate with users to create test scenarios.Execute Tests: Users execute tests and document feedback.Address Feedback: Resolve any issues or defects found during UAT.Sign-off: Obtain formal approval from users.5. ConclusionFollowing these steps ensures thorough testing, high-quality deliverables, and successful deployment of MicroStrategy projects.
