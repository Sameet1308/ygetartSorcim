"""
This script iterates through all loaded projects in the MicroStrategy server,
consolidates all project settings along with their descriptions and types, and saves
them into a single CSV file.

This script will not work without replacing parameters with real values.
Its basic goal is to present what can be done with this module and to
ease its usage.
